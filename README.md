Welcome to my first Springboot project

This is a project inspired by MyAnimeList.net

Some features of this application includes:

- Being able to view top animes from different genres
- Being able to search past, present, and even upcoming animes
- Search for more information regarding a particular anime
- Create an account and add anime to your own watchlist
- Be recommended a list of anime for you to watch based on your watchlist

Technologies:
- Thymeleaf as a server-side template engine, with BootStrap and SwiperJS for designing the application
- Java SpringBoot for backend
- Redis for caching and being used as a small database
